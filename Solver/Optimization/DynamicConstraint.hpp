         * Implementation of Ipopt's pure virtual TNLP class.
         * 
         * TNLP defines Ipopt's interface to the model. This is in fact 
         * the model evaluator interface to Ipopt. In this case however, 
         * the model evaluator calls dynamic solver to compute the objective 
         * and the gradient.
         * 
         * \note This clas is based on Cosmin's reformulation of the dynamic
         * constrained optimization problem. For now it is hard-wired to
         * 1-parameter optimization problems.
